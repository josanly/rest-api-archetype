# Swagger UI

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swagger-api/swagger-ui.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/swagger-api/swagger-ui)

Swagger UI is part of the Swagger project.  The Swagger project allows you to produce, visualize and consume your OWN RESTful services.  No proxy or 3rd party services required.  Do it your own way.

Swagger UI is a dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically
generate beautiful documentation and sandbox from a Swagger-compliant API. Because Swagger UI has no dependencies, you can host it in any server environment, or on your local machine.

## What's Swagger?

The goal of Swaggerâ„¢ is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, Swagger removes the guesswork in calling the service.


Check out [Swagger-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec) for additional information about the Swagger project, including additional libraries with support for other languages and more.


## Compatibility
The Swagger Specification has undergone 4 revisions since initial creation in 2010.  Compatibility between swagger-ui and the Swagger specification is as follows:

## How to Use It

### Download
You can use the swagger-ui code AS-IS!  No need to build or recompile--just clone this repo and use the pre-built files in the `dist` folder.  If you like swagger-ui as-is, stop here.

### Build
You can rebuild swagger-ui on your own to tweak it or just so you can say you did.  To do so, follow these steps:

1. `npm install`
2. `gulp`
3. You should see the distribution under the dist folder. Open [`./dist/index.html`](./dist/index.html) to launch Swagger UI in a browser

### Development
Use `gulp watch` to make a new build and watch for changes in files.

### Build using Docker

To build swagger-ui using a docker container:

```
docker build -t swagger-ui-builder .
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 swagger-ui-builder
```

This will start Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080`.
### Use
Once you open the Swagger UI, it will load the [Swagger Petstore](http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/v2/swagger.json) service and show its APIs.  You can enter your own server url and click explore to view the API.

### Customize
You may choose to customize Swagger UI for your organization. Here is an overview of whats in its various directories:

-    dist: Contains a distribution which you can deploy on a server or load from your local machine.
-    lib: Contains javascript dependencies which swagger-ui depends on
-    node_modules: Contains node modules which swagger-ui uses for its development.
-    src
-    src/main/coffeescript: main code in CoffeeScript
-    src/main/templates: [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templates used to render swagger-ui
-    src/main/html: the html files, some images and css
-    src/main/javascript: some legacy javascript referenced by CoffeeScript code

### SwaggerUi
To use swagger-ui you should take a look at the [source of swagger-ui html page](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/dist/index.html) and customize it. This basically requires you to instantiate a SwaggerUi object and call load() on it as below:

```javascript
    window.swaggerUi = new SwaggerUi({
        url:"http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/v2/swagger.json",
        dom_id:"swagger-ui-container"
    });

    window.swaggerUi.load();
```

##### Parameters

Parameter Name | Description
--- | ---
url | The url pointing to `swagger.json` (Swagger 2.0) or the resource listing (earlier versions) as per [Swagger Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/).
spec | A JSON object describing the Swagger specification. When used, the `url` parameter will not be parsed. This is useful for testing manually-generated specifications without hosting them. Works for Swagger 2.0 specs only.
validatorUrl | By default, Swagger-UI attempts to validate specs against swagger.io's online validator. You can use this parameter to set a different validator URL, for example for locally deployed validators ([Validator Badge](https://github.com/swagger-api/validator-badge)). Setting it to `null` will disable validation. This parameter is relevant for Swagger 2.0 specs only.
dom_id | The id of a dom element inside which SwaggerUi will put the user interface for swagger.
booleanValues | SwaggerUI renders boolean data types as a dropdown. By default it provides a 'true' and 'false' string as the possible choices. You can use this parameter to change the values in dropdown to be something else, for example 0 and 1 by setting booleanValues to new Array(0, 1).
docExpansion | Controls how the API listing is displayed. It can be set to 'none' (default), 'list' (shows operations for each resource), or 'full' (fully expanded: shows operations and their details).
sorter | Apply a sort to the API list. It can be 'alpha' (sort paths alphanumerically) or 'method' (sort operations by HTTP method). Default is the order returned by the server unchanged.
onComplete | This is a callback function parameter which can be passed to be notified of when SwaggerUI has completed rendering successfully.
onFailure | This is a callback function parameter which can be passed to be notified of when SwaggerUI encountered a failure was unable to render.
highlightSizeThreshold | Any size response below this threshold will be highlighted syntactically, attempting to highlight large responses can lead to browser hangs, not including a threshold will default to highlight all returned responses.

* All other parameters are explained in greater detail below


### HTTP Methods and API Invocation
swagger-ui supports invocation of all HTTP methods APIs including GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS.  These are handled in the [swagger-js](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js) project, please see there for specifics on their usage.


### Header Parameters
Header params are supported through a pluggable mechanism in [swagger-js](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js).  You can see the [index.html](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/master/dist/index.html) for a sample of how to dynamically set headers:

```js
// add a new ApiKeyAuthorization when the api-key changes in the ui.
$('#input_apiKey').change(function() {
  var key = $('#input_apiKey')[0].value;
  if(key && key.trim() != "") {
    window.authorizations.add("key", new ApiKeyAuthorization("api_key", key, "header"));
  }
})
```

This will add header `api_key` with value `key` on every call to the server.  You can substitute `query` to send the values as a query param.

### Custom Header Parameters - (For Basic auth etc)
If you have some header parameters which you need to send with every request, use the headers as below:

```js
window.authorizations.add("key", new ApiKeyAuthorization("Authorization", "XXXX", "header"));
```

Note!  You can pass multiple header params on a single request, just use unique names for them (`key` is used in the above example).

## CORS Support

CORS is a technique to prevent websites from doing bad things with your personal data.  Most browsers + javascript toolkits not only support CORS but enforce it, which has implications for your API server which supports Swagger.

You can read about CORS here: http://www.w3.org/TR/cors.

There are two cases where no action is needed for CORS support:

1. swagger-ui is hosted on the same server as the application itself (same host *and* port).
2. The application is located behind a proxy that enables the requires CORS headers. This may already be covered within your organization.

Otherwise, CORS support needs to be enabled for:

1. Your Swagger docs. For Swagger 2.0 it's the `swagger.json` and any externally `$ref`ed docs, and for prior version it's the `Resource Listing` and `API Declaration` files.
2. For the `Try it now` button to work, CORS needs to be enabled on your API endpoints as well.

### Testing CORS Support

You can verify CORS support with one of three techniques:

- Curl your API and inspect the headers.  For instance:

```bash
$ curl -I "http://petstore.swagger.wordnik.com/v2/swagger.json"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 31 Jan 2015 23:05:44 GMT
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, api_key, Authorization
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 0
```

This tells us that the petstore resource listing supports OPTIONS, and the following headers:  `Content-Type`, `api_key`, `Authorization`.

- Try swagger-ui from your file system and look at the debug console.  If CORS is not enabled, you'll see something like this:

```
XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://sad.server.com/v2/api-docs. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.
```

Swagger-UI cannot easily show this error state.

- Using the http://www.test-cors.org website. Keep in mind this will show a successful result even if `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` is not available, which is still required for Swagger-UI to function properly.

### Enabling CORS

The method of enabling CORS depends on the server and/or framework you use to host your application. http://enable-cors.org provides information on how to enable CORS in some common web servers.

Other servers/frameworks may provide you information on how to enable it specifically in their use case.

### CORS and Header Parameters

Swagger lets you easily send headers as parameters to requests.  The name of these headers *MUST* be supported in your CORS configuration as well.  From our example above:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, api_key, Authorization
```

Only headers with these names will be allowed to be sent by Swagger-UI.

## How to Improve It

Create your own fork of [swagger-api/swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui)

To share your changes, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/pull/new/master).

Since the javascript files are compiled from coffeescript, please submit changes in the *.coffee files!  We have to reject changes only in the .js files as they will be lost on each build of the ui.
